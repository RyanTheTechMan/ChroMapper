# This is ChroMapper.
ChroMapper is an in-development, Unity-based map editor for Beat Saber, specializing in modded map creation. ChroMapper also offers various tools and features that tailor towards the advanced mappers of the community.

## Why?
*(Inspiration from [BeatMapper](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/beatmapper))*

Why would you choose ChroMapper over an already existing map editor, or even the official editor? Here's a simple table that lets you compare and contrast what makes each editor unique.

|Feature|ChroMapper|MediocreMapper|EditSaber|BeatMapper|Official Editor|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|**Engine/Framework**|Unity|Unreal|Unreal|React (JavaScript)|Unity|
|**Availability**|Standalone|Standalone|Standalone|Web Browser|Bundled w/PCVR|
|**Platform**|Windows|Windows|Windows|Fuckin' Anywhere|Various|
|**Perspective**|3D|3D|3D|3D/2D|2D|
|**Mapping Extensions**|🗹|🗹|🗷|🗷|🗷|
|**Chroma RGB Lightmapping**|🗹|🗹|🗷|🗷|🗷|
|**ChromaToggle**|🗹|🗹|🗷|🗷|🗷|
|**Beatmap v2 Support**|🗹|🗹|🗷|🗹|🗹|
|**Ring Propagation**|🗹|🗷|🗷|🗷|🗷|

With that big chart out of the way, here are some reasons why ChroMapper might better appeal to you than the other editors.
- Being built in **Unity** means ChroMapper has the potential to be visually closer to Beat Saber than any other map editor, and [the results do show.](https://streamable.com/a0lh6)
- Being **designed for modded charts** means you can easily design maps that utilize Chroma RGB lighting or improvements brought from Mapping Extensions.
- **Custom Platforms** outside of the base game set means you can preview your map with other platforms in the editor.
- The **Node Editor** allows you to manually input custom data into map objects, and give you a degree of control that no other editor has.
- **Beatmap v2 Support** means you do not have to run your song through a conversion tool in order to play it in Beat Saber, upload it to BeatSaver, or load it onto your Oculus Quest.
- Being **BeatSaver Schema Ready** means you can upload your songs to BeatSaver without need of a tool, or manual conversion.
- Supporting **360 Degree Levels** means that you can spin me right round, baby, right round!
- **Open Source** means that you too can contribute to this ever expanding project.

# Releases

Closed Beta is here!

Links to the application form have been sent out to places that contain a good amount of potentailly interested mappers. If you would like a link, well, just dig. If you can't find one, then you will probably be better off waiting for Open Beta.

Some expectations I'd like to set before hand: ChroMapper is still not *release*. While this may be a viable mapping tool, features one might call a "necessity" might not be implemented yet. Bugs should also be expected, as a team as small as myself and the closed alpha team probably haven't swept through everything.

If you wish to follow ChroMapper development, [here is the Trello board for ChroMapper.](https://trello.com/b/j2ikcHZh/chromapper-development) Here, you can figure out all that has been suggested by the closed alpha testing crew, what we are currently working on, and what has been done.

## Patreon

If you'd like to donate to the project and get some sweet perks, you can [support SkyKiwi and Chroma development on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Chroma). The ChromaToggle Sabers tier ($5+) will get you access to ChroMapper closed alpha testing.

When ChroMapper hits Open Beta, patreon members (and previous Closed Alpha members) will receive hotfix, preview, and other pre-release builds faster than the public.

# For Developers
ChroMapper is developed with Unity **2019.3.0f6**.

This GitHub repository should come with the assets and scripts you need to easily open it up in Unity. Feel free to fork the repository if you plan on contributing to ChroMapper in any way. Even though ChroMapper is in closed alpha, if you are able to clone or fork and get the project working on your end, I'll allow you to use it as long as you're making contributions to ChroMapper.

Also keep in mind of the [GNU GPL v2 license](https://github.com/Caeden117/ChroMapper/blob/master/LICENSE) that I picked for ChroMapper. If you were to make a fork and build off of that (a la MediocreMapper from EditSaber), your source code must be made public, and changes must be stated, while all being under the same license. Pull requests, however, I'll be more lenient on.
